# A template for your next React project

## Boilerplate
- get the latest react boilerplate code to start the project with.
- have project with routes, navlinks, styles and much more things already set up so you dont have to worry about that.

## Carefully crafted
- In this project i am trying my best to follow the best code practices and ðŸŒŸCLEAN CODE ðŸŒŸ
- Get the latest packages used (i.e : react-router-dom v6)
- Code written with advance / mediocre concepts like Redux, refs, ect.

## Customizable
- I have tried to make it as customizable as possible while keeping in mind that you don't have to code extra components.
- colorschemes can be changes ( check custom.scss )
